- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the development server
  - The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default
  - The page will reload if you make edits
  - You will also see any lint errors in the console
- Alternatively, run `npm run build` to build the app for production
  - The bundle will be created in the `dist` folder
  - This repo does not include a server, so you will need to serve the files using a server of your choice
